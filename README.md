# MyTuitionBuddy www.mytuitionbuddy.com
<P>
  MyTuitionBuddy is an idea, which i got when one of our house help was looking for someone to help her son understand math topics. I helped him understand many math concepts in his 6th class. Then i thought, there might be many students like this who need helps but don't have any tuition fee to pay. I decided to do my summer 2024 project on this topic and designed application MyTuitionBuddy where anybody can register and ask for help on any topics. We are group of students who volunteered to take out some time and help these students.
